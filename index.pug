                p More than just a visitors center for the Catskill Park, the reimagined Catskill Interpretive Center will act as a community Gathering Space, a Mountain House, Ranger Station, Observatory and Research Lab.
                p Situated on 60 acres of forest, fields and wetlands in the hamlet of Mount Tremper, the center is already known to the community for its walking trails, sculpture park showcasing local Catskill artisans, picnic areas, and access to the Esopus Creek.

                p Since 1969, the Catskill Center has been protecting and fostering the environmental, cultural and economic well-being of the Catskill region. Along the way, the Center has developed an extensive archive of Park-related research materials, phenological data, oral histories, environmental curriculum, charismatic objects, art, crafts, along with books by local naturalists, botanists, geologists and conservationists.
                p The new Interpretive Center will engage with the Center’s archive, allowing the public to experience the history of the region.
